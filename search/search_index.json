RBAC differs from access control lists (ACL) by putting the emphasis on roles and their permissions rather than objects (resources). For the purposes of this documentation: an identity has one or more roles. a role requests access to a permission. a permission is given to a role. Thus, RBAC has the following model: many to many relationship between identities and roles . many to many relationship between roles and permissions . roles can have parent and child roles (hierarchy of roles). Roles To create a role, create a new class that implements Laminas\\Permission\\Rbac\\RoleInterface or use the default role class, Laminas\\Permission\\Rbac\\Role . You can instantiate a role and add it to the RBAC container or add a role directly using the RBAC container addRole() method. Permissions Each role can have zero or more permissions and can be set directly to the role or by first retrieving the role from the RBAC container. Any parent role will inherit the permissions of their children. Dynamic Assertions In certain situations simply checking a permission key for access may not be enough. For example, assume two users, Foo and Bar, both have article.edit permission. What's to stop Bar from editing Foo's articles? The answer is dynamic assertions which allow you to specify extra runtime credentials that must pass for access to be granted.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"intro/#introduction","text":"laminas-permissions-rbac provides a lightweight Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in PHP.

This document details the changes Minimum supported PHP version Version 3 drops support for PHP versions prior to PHP 7.1. AssertionInterface The primary change is the Laminas\\Permissions\\Rbac\\AssertionInterface::assert() method definition. The new assert method has the following signature: namespace Laminas\\Permissions\\Rbac; public function assert( Rbac $rbac, RoleInterface $role, string $permission ) : bool The version 2 releases defined the method such that it only accepted a single parameter, Rbac $rbac . Version 3 adds the $role and $permission parameters. This simplifies implementation of dynamic assertions using the role and the permission information. For instance, imagine you want to disable a specific permission foo for an admin role; you can implement that as follows: public function assert(Rbac $rbac, RoleInterface $role, string $permission) : bool { return ! ($permission === 'foo' &amp;&amp; $role-&gt;getName() === 'admin'); } If you were previously implementing AssertionInterface , you will need to update the assert() signature to match the changes in version 3. If you were creating assertions as PHP callables, you may continue to use the existing signature; however, you may also expand them to accept the new arguments should they assist you in creating more complex, dynamic assertions. RoleInterface Laminas\\Permissions\\Rbac\\RoleInterface also received a number of changes, including type hints and method name changes. Type hints With the update to PHP 7.1 , we also updated the RoleInterface to provide: scalar type hints where applicable ( addPermission() and hasPermission() ). add return type hints (including scalar type hints) to all methods. You will need to examine the RoleInterface definitions to determine what changes to make to your implementations. setParent becomes addParent In version 3, we renamed the method Role::setParent() to Role::addParent() . This naming is more consistent with other method names, such as Role::addChild() , and also makes clear that more than one parent may be provided to any given role. getParent becomes getParents In line with the previous change, getParent() was also renamed to getParents() , which returns an array of RoleInterface instances. Removed support for string arguments in Role::addChild Version 3 no longer allows adding a child using a string role name; you may only provide RoleInterface instances. Adds getChildren Since roles may have multiple children, the method getChildren() was added; it returns an array of RoleInterface instances.","title":"v2.X to v3.0"},{"location":"migration/to-v3-0/#upgrading-to-30","text":"If you upgrade from version 2 releases, you will notice a few changes.
